# isBusinessTourRigged

This repo aims to check the dice rolls and verify if the game "Business Tour" is rigged or not.

Conclusion so far:
 
 The chi-squared value is over the critical value for a 6 freedom degree system. We hence reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the game is rigged. However, the number of samples is still low and improvements are soon to come on this point.
